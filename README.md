## Draw text with a Python Turtle!

[![textturtle](https://raw.github.com/theepdinker/textturtle/master/screenshot.png)](#features)

TextTurtle is a Turtle that can draw text!

Compatible with the Turtle methods that you may be familiar with
(it is a subclass of Turtle), but with the additional talent of drawing text.

simple use case:
    from textturtle import TextTurtle
    t = TextTurtle()
    t.text("hello")

The TextTurtle alphabet is uppercase ASCII, plus a space character.
Sorry, no punctuation for emiticons :(

You can use the standard Turtle method write() if you want other 
characters (but then you can't watch the Turtle draw it)

(and I am sure that you are clever enough to add characters with your Turtle!)
